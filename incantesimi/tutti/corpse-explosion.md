## Corpse Explosion
*2° livello, Necromanzia*

- **Tempo di lancio:** 1 azione
- **Raggio d'azione:** 18m
- **Componenti:** S
- **Durata:** Istantaneo

As you snap your fingers, a dead creature within range explodes with necrotic energy. Each creature in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on the dead creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 2d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with this spell, the creature explodes, repeating the same effect as this spell. If an undead creature is affected by this spell or its explosion, then it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or explode, repeating the same effect as this spell a number of times equal to half its CR (a minimum of 1 time).

**Ai livelli superiori:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd

**Classi:** Chierico, Stregone, Warlock, Mago
