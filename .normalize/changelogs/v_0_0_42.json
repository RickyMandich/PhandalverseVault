A creature that fails on a dexterity saving throw takes 1d6 poison damage, or half as much on a success.\n-\n-On subsequent turns, you can direct the swarm to attack another creature within range, or move back to you, as a bonus action. If the swarm ever leaves the range, the spell ends.\n-\n-At higher Levels. When cast using a 2nd level Spell-slot, the damage increases by 1d6 for every level above 2nd.\n-\n----\n-\n-SCYTHE OF HADES\n-2nd-Level Necromancy\n-\n-Casting Time: 1 Action\n-Range: Touch\n-Components: V, S\n-Duration: Instantaneous\n-\n-You form a scythe of necrotic energy and swing it at a creature within range. That creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 necrotic damage on a failure or half as much on a success.\n-\n-A humanoid that dies to this damage has its flesh stripped from its bones and rises again as a skeleton under your control. The skeleton rolls its own initiative and becomes inanimate after one hour or when it drops to zero hitpoints.\n-\n-At higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.\n-\n----\n-\n-PUTRID PLAGUE\n-3rd-Level Necromancy (ritual)\n-\n-Casting Time: 1 Hour\n-Range: Touch\n-Components: V, S, M (a cup of blood, a parasite egg and herbs worth 150gp, all of which the spell consumes)\n-Duration: Instantaneous\n-\n-\n-You touch the corpse of a large or smaller creature, giving life to a myriad of parasites and maggots feasting on the corpse that collect in the corpses chest cavity. If the corpse is somehow disturbed, its chest blows open.\n-\n-Any creature within 10ft of the corpse must succeed on a Dexterity Saving Throw, taking 4d6 piercing damage and become infested with a parasite. The parasite counts as a disease and deals 2d6 poison damage to its host every hour. It can be removed by another creature using an 30 minute long operation, a cutting implement and a successful DC 15 (Dexterity) Medicine check. On a failure, the creature takes 2d6 slashing damage.\n-\n-If the host is killed while infected, its corpse can, after one hour, spread the disease as if this spell had been cast on it. Burning the corpse, disintegrating it or killing the infected creature with radiant damage prevents this.\n-\n-\n-https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/rybU2vXOQB\n-\n----\n-\n-BONE BLADE\n-Cantrip transmutation\n-\n-Casting Time: 1 bonus action\n-Range: Self\n-Compnents: M (the caster's skeleton or exoskeleton)\n-Duration: 10 minutes.\n-\n-When you cast this spell, you grow claws from your fingertips or extend a short-sword like projection from your wrist.
