Any creature within 10ft of the corpse must succeed on a Dexterity Saving Throw, taking 4d6 piercing damage and become infested with a parasite. The parasite counts as a disease and deals 2d6 poison damage to its host every hour. It can be removed by another creature using an 30 minute long operation, a cutting implement and a successful DC 15 (Dexterity) Medicine check. On a failure, the creature takes 2d6 slashing damage.

If the host is killed while infected, its corpse can, after one hour, spread the disease as if this spell had been cast on it. Burning the corpse, disintegrating it or killing the infected creature with radiant damage prevents this.
